1. Overview of the Problem: 

  The problem solves the problem of Child Education. We have developed an Android application
  that would allow the children to take tests on Mobile Phones and tablets.
  
  The test can be taken offline as well. The results will be stored in the device till it is able
  to connect to the internet.
  
  The test can only be taken when the child is inside the school or centre and not from other places.
  
  The test checks two modules with future scope to extend it to other modules later.
  Now we have provided for tests in Basic English character, words and sentence recognition.
  
    The child will orally speak out the text he sees on the screen and will be evaluated on how many he
    can correctly identify.
    
  We have also provided for a basic Math test comprising of simple arithmetic operations like
    Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
    
    The child will solve the question and chose from the options provided.
  
  
2. Technology Stack Used:

  Android SDK
  Text to Speech API
  
3. Steps to build Code: 
  Install the Android application in your phone/tablet and simply launch it as any other application.
