# BalUtsav NGO Android Application

**1. Overview of the Problem:**

    -The problem solves the problem of Child Education. We have developed an Android application <br />
    that would allow the children to take tests on Mobile Phones and tablets. <br />
  
        -The test can be taken offline as well. The results will be stored in the device till it is able
        to connect to the internet. <br />

    -The test can only be taken when the child is inside the school or centre and not from other places. <br />
  
    -The test checks two modules with future scope to extend it to other modules later. <br />
  
    -Now we have provided for tests in Basic English character, words and sentence recognition. <br />
  
        -The child will orally speak out the text he sees on the screen and will be evaluated on how many he
        can correctly identify. 
    
    
    -We have also provided for a basic Math test comprising of simple arithmetic operations like <br />
        -Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. 
        <br />
    
        -The child will solve the question and chose from the options provided.
